# React practical assignment 
**Unsplash image search application**

The main idea of this application is to test potential employee of his or her’s abilities to implement <br/>
a simple image search application by using unsplash.com API. Potential candidate should create <br/>
free developer account on the specified API page and use it in the web application.

### The task
1. Set up:\
  a. Build a simple, comprehensive and responsive layout\
  b. Use unsplash.com image retrieval API
2. Basic image search functionality:\
  a. Use Search endpoints from the Unsplash API\
  b. Display a search input field with a “Search” button\
  c. Display search results in a grid layout\
  d. “Remember” previous search queries in local storage (no duplicates)
  e. Suggest last 5 search queries in the search input as an autocomplete dropdown
3. User authentication:\
  a. Use User Authentication Workflow from the Unsplash API\
  b. Display a “Log in” button for anonymous users\
  c. Provide a “Log Out” feature for logged in users
4. Interactive features:\
  a. Use Like/Unlike Photos endpoints from the Unsplash API\
  b. For logged in users, provide a “Like” button for each photo\
  c. For logged in users, if the photo is liked, provide an “Unlike” button

### Tips
* Source code should be stored in GitHub, BitBucket or any other version control platform
* Project should have a comprehensive README file
* Project directory should be logically structured
* Source code should be clean and formatted accordingly
* API key should be stored in .env and not committed to git (we have our own API keys to test)
